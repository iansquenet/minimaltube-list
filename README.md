# MinimalTube (A BlockTube list)
My personal [BlockTube](https://github.com/amitbl/blocktube) export config list that includes video title keywords and some channel IDs.

## About

This list should help keep away from distractions and clickbait. I've come up with all the keywords.

As of now there are no categories, but all the keywords are alphabetically sorted and ends with symbols and emojis.

If you'd like to share more keywords or something else via issue or pull request, I'd appreciate it.

## Types of keywords included
Hashtags, clickbait words, challenges, certain movies and TV shows, swear-words, right-wing commentators and people, certain YouTubers and celebrities, cringe, i paid / i survived, video games, setup videos, memes, parodies, guns.  

Basically taking out all fun and being a bit excessive, but for myself, it works.
